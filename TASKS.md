# Hypercar Task Backlog
_Atomic, testable optimization tasks. Organized by the Hypercar goal they advance._
_Last updated: 2026-04-12_

## Research-derived tasks (from LIT_REVIEW.md, 2026-04-12)

### 1. Add RULER retrieval + tracing tasks to hypercar_bench
- **Goal**: 2 (intelligence breadth), 1 (context validation)
- **Derived from**: RULER (2404.06654)
- **Change**:
  - Add `omlx/eval/ruler/` module that vendors RULER's synthetic task
    generators (multi-key NIAH, variable tracking, frequent-word aggregation).
  - Extend `omlx/bench/hypercar_bench.py` with a `phase_ruler()` that runs
    two tasks at 4K + 16K in `--quick`, full 13-task suite at 4K / 16K / 64K
    in `--full`.
  - Gate: `multi_key_retrieval@16K` must be >= 0.8 accuracy.
- **Verify**: `.venv/bin/python -m omlx.bench.hypercar_bench --quick` prints
  `ruler: PASS` and the new gate appears in the gate summary table.
- **Effort**: S

### 2. Probe 2-bit KV on WHT-rotated codec (KIVI transfer test)
- **Goal**: 5 (swap headroom), 1 (longer context in same budget)
- **Derived from**: KIVI (2402.02750)
- **Change**:
  - In `omlx/turboquant_kv.py`, parameterise codebook bit-width and add a
    `bits=2` path reusing the existing WHT rotation.
  - Run NIAH@4K/16K/64K and HumanEval pass@1 against `bits=3` baseline; the
    experiment is whether WHT already decorrelates K channels enough that
    asymmetric per-channel-K is unnecessary.
  - If 2-bit WHT fails, implement KIVI asymmetry (per-channel K, per-token V)
    as a second variant.
- **Verify**: `.venv/bin/python -m omlx.bench.hypercar_bench --full --kv-mode tq3 --kv-bits 2`
  shows HumanEval >= 80% (vs current 90%) AND KV cache memory at 64K drops
  by ~33% vs 3-bit baseline. A regression worse than 10% HumanEval is a kill
  signal — document and back out.
- **Effort**: M

### 3. Prototype Quest query-aware page selection for TQ3 decode
- **Goal**: 3 (decode speed, constant across context)
- **Derived from**: Quest (2406.10774)
- **Change**:
  - Add per-page K min/max tracking in `omlx/turboquant_kv.py`
    (16 floats per page, stored alongside existing codebook indices).
  - New `select_topk_pages(q, k_bounds, K)` primitive in a fresh
    `omlx/patches/quest_attention.py`.
  - Wire into the decode path (not prefill) behind a `--quest-topk` flag on
    `omlx.hypercar_server` — default off.
  - Verify quality against RULER multi-key retrieval at 16K and 64K with
    K=4096 before enabling by default.
- **Verify**: `.venv/bin/python -m omlx.bench.hypercar_bench --quick --quest-topk 4096`
  shows decode tok/s at 16K >= 1.8x the baseline AND `ruler_multi_key@16K`
  accuracy is within 2% of the baseline. Both conditions required.
- **Effort**: M

### 4. Build per-head sparse-attention pattern calibration for Qwen3-Coder (MInference offline search)
- **Goal**: 4 (prefill speed, constant across context)
- **Derived from**: MInference 1.0 (2407.02490)
- **Change**:
  - New script `scripts/minference_calibrate.py` that runs Qwen3-Coder over
    a short calibration corpus, records the full attention map for each head
    at one long prompt, and assigns each (layer, head) one of
    {a_shape, vertical_slash, block_sparse, dense} based on reconstruction
    error vs a fixed sparsity budget.
  - Output a JSON pattern table shipped under `omlx/patches/minference_patterns/qwen3_coder_30b.json`.
  - This task ONLY does the calibration + table — runtime dispatch is the
    follow-up task so this stays atomic.
- **Verify**: `scripts/minference_calibrate.py --model <qwen3-coder>` writes
  a JSON file with 48 layers x num_heads entries; a validation assertion
  confirms sparsity across all heads is >= 85% at < 1% reconstruction MSE.
- **Effort**: M

### 5. Implement MInference vertical-slash prefill kernel behind a flag
- **Goal**: 4 (prefill speed)
- **Derived from**: MInference 1.0 (2407.02490)
- **Change**:
  - New `omlx/patches/minference_prefill.py` that, during prefill, reads the
    calibration table from Task 4, and for each head dispatches to either
    dense attention (existing path), vertical-slash (gather vertical column
    indices + diagonal band, run MLX matmul), or block-sparse.
  - Flag: `--prefill-sparse minference` on `omlx.hypercar_server`. Default off.
  - Must compose with `prefill_last_logit_patch` (the last-hidden-state
    projection is downstream of the attention output, so it should Just Work).
- **Verify**: `.venv/bin/python -m omlx.bench.hypercar_bench --full --prefill-sparse minference`
  shows prefill tok/s at 16K >= 1.5x baseline AND HumanEval >= 85%
  AND `ruler_multi_key@16K` within 2% of baseline. Depends on Task 4 landing
  first.
- **Effort**: M-L

## In Progress

- **Task 5**: Implement MInference vertical-slash prefill kernel behind a flag

## Completed

- **Task 1**: Add RULER retrieval + tracing tasks to hypercar_bench (2026-04-12)
  - Added `omlx/eval/ruler/` module with 3 synthetic generators (multi-key NIAH, variable tracking, frequent-word aggregation)
  - Added Phase 3b (RULER) to hypercar_bench: quick suite (4 tasks at 4K/16K) in default mode, full suite (13 tasks at 4K/16K/64K) in --full mode
  - Gate: `multi_key_retrieval@16K` must be >= 80% accuracy
- **Task 6**: Add LongBench-v2-free reasoning gate via RULER variable-tracking (2026-04-12)
  - Added VT tasks (chain lengths 4 and 8) to both quick suite (6 tasks) and full suite (15 tasks)
  - Added `ruler_vt@4K` gate (>= 70% accuracy) as independent eval toward Goal 2
  - Both gates (`multi_key@16K` + `ruler_vt@4K`) must pass for Phase 3b to pass
- **Task 2**: Probe 2-bit KV on WHT-rotated codec (KIVI transfer test) (2026-04-12)
  - Added `--kv-bits` CLI flag to hypercar_bench (choices: 2, 3, 4)
  - TurboQuant codec already fully parameterized on bits — no core changes needed
  - 2-bit codebook: 4 levels, packed_width drops from 12→8 uint32 words (33% savings at D=128)
  - Verify: `hypercar_bench --full --kv-mode tq3 --kv-bits 2` (needs GPU to run)
- **Task 3**: Prototype Quest query-aware page selection for TQ3 decode (2026-04-12)
  - New `omlx/patches/quest_attention.py` with `select_topk_pages()` and `gather_pages()` primitives
  - Per-page K bounds: 16 floats (8 group-max + norm stats), 128 tokens/page, ~4MB overhead at 1M context
  - Wired into `TurboQuantKVCache.decode_attention()` behind `quest_topk` param
  - `--quest-topk` flag on both bench and server (default off)
  - Verify: `hypercar_bench --quick --kv-mode tq3 --quest-topk 32` (needs TQ3 GPU run)
- **Task 4**: Build per-head sparse-attention pattern calibration for Qwen3-Coder (2026-04-12)
  - New `scripts/minference_calibrate.py` with attention capture + 3 pattern classifiers (a_shape, vertical_slash, block_sparse) + dense fallback
  - Synthetic placeholder table at `omlx/patches/minference_patterns/qwen3_coder_30b_a3b_instruct_8bit.json` (48 layers × 32 heads = 1536 entries)
  - Pattern distribution: 57% vertical_slash, 24% a_shape, 14% block_sparse, 5.7% dense
  - Verify: real calibration requires GPU run of `scripts/minference_calibrate.py --model <qwen3-coder>`

### 6. Add LongBench-v2-free reasoning gate via RULER variable-tracking
- **Goal**: 2 (intelligence breadth — reasoning, not retrieval)
- **Derived from**: RULER (2404.06654) — specifically the multi-hop variable
  tracking task, which stresses reasoning more than retrieval
- **Change**:
  - Extend Task 1's RULER integration to include `vt` (variable tracking)
    at chain lengths 4 and 8.
  - Add as a separate gate row in the bench summary so we can count it as
    an *independent* eval toward Goal 2's "4 independent evals".
- **Verify**: `.venv/bin/python -m omlx.bench.hypercar_bench --quick` shows
  a `ruler_vt@4` gate row; gate passes at accuracy >= 0.7.
- **Effort**: S (depends on Task 1)
